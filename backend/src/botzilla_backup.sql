The owner is super cool and a fire captain. This is right in fire zone. Street parking is easy in front of the house. There are 2 attic entrances so there will be 2 separate set ups. Attic is 1640 sq ft total. 1st entrance is in the main hallway and the 2nd is in the back of the house. Set up needs to be in on point. 1st attic entrance accesses the main part of the attic. This is just a blow in fiber. The 2nd attic attic entrance accesses a tighter section that is 485 sq ft. I built 2 sections for the same attic. 	5882.42	4705.94	0.00	2025-07-03 15:05:11.439	2025-07-02 22:42:09.994	2025-08-01 13:52:08.904-03	2025-08-18 08:40:28.453-03	\N	\N

Bring extra tube for topping off insulation in attic\n\nCUSTOMER PROFILE:\n\nMet Vonda on site, she was friendly when talking about personal interest like dogs, but definitely focus on business to move through the inspection. Did most of my project presentation with her husband, Richard (Rick) he’s very analytical, and was not looking to spend any money on this project that was not absolutely necessary. He does see the value and quality work, but I didn’t want to spend that money for the new homeowners.\n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS:\n\nNo obstructions or hazards\n\nOUT OF ORIGINARY / FINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nThis is a unique real estate project that we’ve coordinated closely with Brandon and Dario. Our portion of the work involves removing the cardboard casing around the concrete footers in the basement. Please bring a disc saw to cut vertical relief lines in the cardboard, along with a wire brush and any necessary grinding tools to help remove the remaining material from the concrete surface. While the removal doesn’t need to be flawless, please take the time to clean the pillars as thoroughly as possible within the time allotted. Once the cardboard is removed, be sure to collect as much debris as possible and use a leaf blower to clear away any remaining dust or fragments. We’re aiming for a clean finish that photographs well.\n\nUpstairs in the attic, the insulation should be topped off and leveled out to the best of your ability using the materials available and within the time provided. Aim to create an even, finished appearance throughout the space.\n\nBecause this is a real estate project, clear and professional finish photos are a must. Please take the time to capture clean, well-lit shots of both the attic and the cleaned concrete footers. These photos should be sent out to the team as soon as the job is complete. If any questions come up during the project, don’t hesitate to reach out to PM Nate Woods directly.	3819.04	3819.04	0.00	2025-08-06 23:48:12.893	2025-08-01 21:21:33.524	2025-08-01 21:59:36.856-03	2025-08-18 08:40:24.982-03	shop@olsoncrew.com	2069103119

Attic is very narrow and has steel ducts. We may need to cut up to 2 access points to service the entire attic. Crawlspace access to left of garage. Door is sealed at the top with flex glue that serves as a hinge. Lean something against the door to hold it open. There is a crack on the bottom board of the door but held together solid with the steel mesh, just be gentle with opening and closing.\n\nBuilding Details:\n1 story. Very shallow attic. Steel ducts in attic\n\nCustomer Profile:\n***CONTACT TENANT DIRECTLY FOR SCHEDULING*** Tanys Evangelisti: 858-405-5548\nProperty owner is Annie Boyd, who is positive and upbeat. Did not bat an eye approving our scope of work as this has been an on-going issue and she knows we’re the only solution.\n\nTenants are Tanys (sounds like Tanniss) and Tommy Evangelisti. Their son, Tommy, used our service on his home in Del Mar and recommended us highly. They are very excited we will be doing this work here. Tanys and Tommy are both very cheerful and easy going.\n\nObstructions and Hazards: \nTight access. Home is very clean with white table clothes on indoor and outdoor tables. Be very mindful of home prep and working clean here.\n\nSpecialty Jobs / Final Thoughts:\nThe big and easy spots have been RP by another company, but they missed several small holes. No one entered the crawlspace and caught the holes in vent screen under the back deck. RP also needed near the garage with several holes in the concrete and many utility penetrations into the subfloor and walls. \n\nWe will do our best to hopefully cut only 1 additional attic access point to get our work done. Be strategic in placement and thorough in setup to protect home from debris. We added extra cost for the labor and setup to account for this.\n\nCREW REQUEST- OSCAR. Attic is very tight so we’ll need a small guy to reach the shallowest parts	13939.90	13939.90	0.00	2025-07-31 15:37:22.67	2025-06-25 22:15:49.254	2025-08-01 13:52:02.699-03	2025-08-18 08:40:25.617-03	\N	\N

The attic access are in the garage and in the master bedroom closet or we’re moving all of the blown in insulation and we’re removing any of the accessible R 19 insulation on the pony walls but we can’t fit a body in the voltage section so don’t worry about that. Just try to rot and improve the section off as best you can to keep them out and separate the spaces. This is a referral from a property manager and the homeowners are elderly. Super nice people. I really hope we take really good care of them. The husband is having major health concerns so let’s do a great set up and take really good care of their home. It’s minimal rodent activity given the size of the space and they should be selling the house in the next year or two. This is a two-faced project. They’re gonna have an electrician come in and change some candle lights halfway through the project as always best of luck.	14884.70	13842.77	0.00	2025-07-09 23:50:27.767	2025-07-09 22:43:40.459	2025-08-01 13:52:07.542-03	2025-08-18 08:40:27.864-03	\N	\N

It’s tight, R-19 is for the skylight frames. —- There is also a heavy ant problem. Please vac out as much of the ants as possible. From what I saw, they are mainly around the vaulted section entrance.

The customer has a designated parking space directly in front of the home.\n\nBUILDING DETAILS\nThe property is a single-story rambler with vaulted ceilings. It has a very small, uninsulated attic space and a large crawlspace.\n\nCUSTOMER PROFILE\nLisa is a friendly and engaging homeowner with a rich life experience, including careers in acting and psychology, extensive travel abroad, and a passion for art. She has a daughter who lives out of town. Now seeking more order and stability, Lisa is investing significantly in redoing her entire crawlspace. Although it appears the crawlspace may have been redone shortly before she purchased the home, it was not properly rodent-proofed. Rodent activity is common on Bainbridge Island, and Lisa is particularly averse to rodents. Rodent proofing should be a top priority to ensure we deliver a service that aligns with our name and warranty guarantees.\n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS\nThe crawlspace entry door provides a very tight squeeze. Inside, crawlspace height ranges from approximately 3 feet to as low as 24 inches.\n\nNOTABLE OBSERVATIONS / FINAL THOUGHTS\nThere are three 8” insulated flex ducts lying on the ground with noticeable extra weight, suggesting they have absorbed water.\n\t•\tOne duct is located immediately upon entering the crawlspace.\n\t•\tThe other two are at the back left side, where they branch off from each other.\n\t•\tRat droppings are present on the two ducts in the back.\n\nThese three ducts should be replaced and properly supported.\n\n\n—- The attic has two very small, tight areas that a person could potentially squeeze into for rodent proofing. Please assign a smaller crew member for this task. If rodent proofing in these areas is not feasible, securely mesh off the openings to prevent rodent entry.\n\nPlease thoroughly rodent proof underside of home to make sure rodents will not have an opportunity to enter living area through kitchen or around heater vents in floor. Customer specifically brought up that the flashing around the heater vent was bent and would like that to be air seal/rodent proof	20834.70	16667.76	0.00	2025-08-14 21:16:50.144	2025-08-14 18:45:37.261	2025-08-15 11:41:34.716-03	2025-08-18 08:40:23.914-03	redstonelisa888@gmail.com	415-603-8165

The Attic access is on the far right side of the house opposite of the driveway. There’s a white fence that you can remove. It’s just a couple of screws to gain access so you don’t have to walk all the way around the back of the house. The homeowners are an elderly couple. The husband was not happy about spending the money so please show him a lot of respect. We’re removing all of the debris in the crawlspace, but there’s some sheet metal attached to the subfloor in one small section. He said we can leave that sheet metal attached to the subfloor and we don’t need to remove the electric furnace. Should be a pretty straightforward job.

However, since the house sits on a corner lot and is slightly elevated, be sure to bring extra vacuum tubing—approximately 35 additional feet will be needed to reach from the vehicle to the front door.\n\n\nBUILDING DETAILS:\nThis is a two-story home with cedar shingle siding. Due to the siding material, we won’t be able to install additional vents or a smart attic fan, which I would have otherwise recommended.\n\n\nCUSTOMER PROFILE:\nBarbara and Mark are both great to work with—friendly, articulate, and thoughtful. Barbara tends to lean into detailed questions and enjoys fact-checking, while Mark prefers to talk shop and engage in broader conversation about life and the home.\n\n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS:\nThe attic contains active knob-and-tube wiring throughout. There’s one particularly challenging area where the attic from a newer addition connects to the original roofline. A cutout section has knob-and-tube wiring running across it. I recommend bringing a couple of 2x4s and a piece of plywood to create a safe temporary platform over the joists—this will help prevent tripping hazards and allow safer access through that section.\n(Reference the attached photos for layout and dimensions.)\n\n\nOUT OF ORDINARY / FINAL THOUGHTS:\nWe’ll be installing a gable fan in the upper attic, mounted in the center rather than directly on to a gable vent. This placement is intended to reduce stagnant air and help prevent future moisture buildup and mold recurrence.\n\nPlease exercise extreme caution around all knob-and-tube wiring.\n\nThe attic has a mix of insulation types: primarily rock wool batts and cellulose, with vermiculite present in the lower attic. The vermiculite will be tested for asbestos before our team enters the space.\n\nThere’s a narrow corridor in the lower attic that needs to be insulated and run proof, bring plywood boards to lay down in order to maneuver	15585.02	13247.26	0.00	2025-08-08 14:31:39.59	2025-08-07 20:50:41.24	2025-08-07 22:38:21.081-03	2025-08-18 08:40:24.819-03	markandbarbara.roller@gmail.com	206-940-7574

The insulation is only two years old, but will have to be replaced due to the insulation getting fouled with asbestos.\nCrawlspace is under the kitchen, and it’s a tall enough crawlspace that is easy to move in. It has moisture, so a vapor barrier is necessary.\nCustomer is British and speaks slowly and softly, and his wife is Italian. 	10256.20	10256.20	1897.50	2025-08-10 16:12:59.163	2025-08-06 21:14:12.197	2025-08-07 09:18:08.832-03	2025-08-18 08:40:24.734-03	mgpeeler@outlook.com	858-754-7358

There is an attic in the knee wall area of the second floor about 540 ft.² and then there’s an attic access in the family room on the second floor.\n\nBuilding details: two-story home about 4000 ft.² in Chula Vista. House is built in the mid 80s. There is a 540 square-foot knee wall area you can walk around in on the second floor. And then there’s about an 1800 square-foot attic above the rest of the home. The attic above the rest of the home is tall however getting around is difficult there is a storage area I kind of like a cubby on the second floor that has a vent cover that can access the attic. It’s a trust attic. One duct has been chewed into moderate rodent activity throughout. Homeowner didn’t even know that they had an attic. \n\nCustomer profile: my contact Ishmael is their employee. Miguel, the owner of the home. It was not present at the inspection. They don’t stay at the house very often.\n\nObstacles/hazards: as long as we can use the second attic entrance there should be no issues.\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: there is a leak in the roof and that area needs to be mold remediated at some point we may consider doing that for the entire attic.	15382.94	13844.64	0.00	2025-07-23 23:22:33.721	2025-07-15 22:54:44.569	2025-08-01 13:52:06.327-03	2025-08-18 08:40:27.391-03	\N	\N

But it’s solid firewall and needs some RP in case the neighbors have rodents at some point in future. \n\n	5720.52	5148.47	0.00	2025-07-22 17:08:28.262	2025-06-27 17:23:15.755	2025-08-01 13:52:06.534-03	2025-08-18 08:40:27.459-03	\N	\N

The crawlspace is located on the right side of the home.\n\nBUILDING DETAILS: The house was built in 1901 and there was an addition done I think roughly 20 years ago you can access both crawls from underneath. Active rodent problem with mice getting into the home so rodent proofing, gaps and cracks leading into the house will be very important\n\nCUSTOMER PROFILE: Casey is a very cool laid-back guy. He works for Boeing and lives in the house by himself and does have a dog. \n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS: No obstructions or hazards that I can think of the crawlspace in entry is a little bit narrow but once you eat inside, it’s pretty easy to move around	10692.44	9302.42	0.00	2025-08-11 14:33:00.666	2025-07-25 17:24:45.057	2025-08-01 13:52:06.124-03	2025-08-18 08:40:24.617-03	\N	\N

Crawlspace entrance is inside of the house and you need a drill to get the door off. The crawlspace is only under the original part of the house. There is a bunch of stuff in the way of the crawlspace so when you call to let the client know you’re on the way ask her to move all of the stuff out of the closet so when you arrive it’s clear for you. \n\nSpecial job notes\n- we are just spot vacuuming droppings in the crawlspace. There is very little droppings only on top of the carpet. Remove the dead bird from the crawlspace. The reason for this job is because the son says he hears a raccoon in the attic but it’s a vaulted ceiling with no attic space. Most of the focus of this job needs to be put on rodent proofing the exterior of the home. There are lots of gaps and imperfections on the house that need to be sealed. Very special note. There is a hole in the stucco in the backyard. This hole supposedly is for the bathroom to breath (what the plumber told them) seal this hole like we seal the roof plumbing pipes (with mesh so it can continue to have air flow and caulking). I will upload of photo and specify this on BT. 	4081.49	4081.49	0.00	2025-08-06 17:35:28.224	2025-08-06 17:07:42.126	2025-08-07 09:18:09.071-03	2025-08-18 08:40:25.087-03	nguyentamy66@gmail.com	\N

The rear crawl space is very small.\n\nCustomer profile: Bill and Yumi are cool people. Yumi speaks broken English, she’s from Japan. Bill is American. No attic but we will have to go on the roof to RP a few vents that are on top. Flat roof with a cool view. Customers will constantly offer food and drinks. Bill does like to chat so heads up for that if you start a conversation. He offered me potato salad like six times. \n\nObstructions and Hazards: There is a 1” diameter pvc pipe that is hanging over the left side (looking at house from street) crawl space door that was attached with a “U” clip into the stucco. He asked if we could put a new screw in it. See photos. Just be careful when opening that particular hatch that we don’t break the PVC pipe.

There is no vapor barrier in the final 10 feet of the crawlspace because it becomes a basement, but there is some insulation in there that does need to be removed. That’s just laying on concrete floor. There is a small bit of debris in the attic to remove before vacuuming everything out but it’s mostly old rock wall from 1949. It’s pretty straightforward except for the access is only 14“ x 20“. I got up there all right but a bigger guy would probably have a tough time. Please call me if you have any questions.

Ron used to work at Boeing as an engineer for a very long time and has a passionate love for planes, he was even so kind as to give me one of his model planes for my son. Please be respectful and do an amazing job at setting up the clean path and taking care of his home during the project. There is a driveway. I believe we are able to use but still BRIMG EXTRA HOSE. There’s approximately 25 feet. from the driveway to the front door and then another 45 feet to the attic entrance, and the attic itself is large as well. His main focus is getting the raccoon out of his attic and having it not come back. The raccoon has two cubs, I saw them going in and out of an access point under The eve above the front door. The home is 35 years old so updating the insulation will help with energy efficiency, but he is primarily just interested in making sure that his home is safe for him and his wife and that the raccoons and their cub are out of his attic and that the insulation has been replaced and sanitized and they do not have a reason to want to come back. I did let him know that we would initially start off by scaring the raccoons out, I didn’t go into details with what method we would use, but that if we were unable to read the attic of the mama and cub that our next steps would be to reach out to PAWS or wildlife to remove the raccoon family prior to starting work. Given that I saw the mama and Cubs going in and out of the house, I believe that coyote urine along with a team of folks going into the attic should be sufficient in reading the attic of the raccoons, allowing our team to do work. We will be installing two insulated flex ducks for their bathroom fans, which are currently going out of their soffits, let them know that that is not the appropriate way to vent, but they do have a cedar shingle roof, and we felt most confident in recommending a roofer to install flapper vents for those rather than our team tackling it. We did promise that we would come back once the flat fences are installed on a service call to hook up those insulated ducks that we have installed. In the meantime, do our best to make sure the insulated ductwork for the bathroom fans are venting as well as possible through up the soffit vents/bird blocks. Again, Ron and his wife are nice friendly to chat with, I’m very kind people.  Please keep them up-to-date with what steps were on, but keep it friendly and brief, Ron’s and engineer, and though he does like to have a friendly conversation, I could see it wearing on him after a little while. Please reach out to PM Nathan Woods with any questions, I’m happy to help. PS: given that there was a mother raccoon with her cub in the attic while I was inspecting, I was unable to do as of an thorough inspection as I had hoped for, there is some buffer room in attic tech to add additional scope of work without having to get the customer involved with additional payment just in case I miss something. But I do believe I was accurate with all of my measurements and the scope of work.\nOPPS: PLEASE EXPEDITE THIS PROJECT, GIVEN THAT I SAW THE RACCOON MOM AND BABY GOING IN AND OUT OF THE HOUSE. I AM CONCERNED THAT IF THEY LEAVE AND DON’T COME BACK, THE PROJECT MAY BE CANCELED. 	14867.71	11894.17	0.00	2025-07-01 19:45:56.707	2025-07-01 18:07:24.697	2025-08-01 13:52:09.025-03	2025-08-18 08:40:28.508-03	\N	\N

Attic has some tight spots toward the soffits but pretty easy to move around otherwise. Customer Profile: Kelly and husband (Luke) are both teachers, and very nice folks. They received a total of five quotes and picked us even though we're most expensive. They're main concern is of course RP, but also creating an overall healthy attic which is why they got a fan as well. Obstructions and Hazards: They have a couple dogs but they were friendly when I was there. \nNails from roof sticking through in some parts, watch noggins. There’s also an old nest of some sort, I jabbed it with a loose board and lifted it up (see video in telegram) and nothing came running out so it seems to be deserted. Not much insulation left as its original to the house (they think) and is mainly dust that most has blown out soffits. Decent amount of roofing debris. No snap traps that I saw but there are a couple glue traps.

Ridge vent and gable vent. Very small rodent activity and mold. Full removal of bay insulation, not the wall insulation. Customer will need insulation on the backside of the attic door. \n\nCustomer Profile:\n\nOld carpenter dude with a big loud dog that’s a gentle sweetheart. He’s really laid back, likes dungeons and dragons and fantasy novels\n\nObstructions and Hazards: present knob and tube. Customer “thinks” it’s not currently in use but let’s be careful.\n\nOut of Ordinary:\n\nUsing R-21 Havloc insulation, attic storage boards 100sf, and a solar fan. See videos for placement.	5960.13	5364.11	0.00	2025-08-05 17:06:34.346	2025-07-17 20:38:08.9	2025-08-07 22:50:15.715-03	2025-08-18 08:40:25.273-03	\N	\N

The attic access is in the master bedroom closet.\n\nBuilding details: rectangle, ranch home 960 square-foot attic just over 4 feet in height 16 inch on center of variety mix of insulation. Lots of debris.\n\nCustomer profile: couple bought the house about a year and a half ago. It was flipped. For the most part it’s in good shape with a few exceptions. The clients are looking into secure the home and be here for a long time.\n\nObstructions and hazards: 1950s construction so there’s a cross beam every like 20 feet that gets in the way it is a mess so there’s a lot of debris that you’re gonna have to deal with getting into the attic. It can be a little challenging due to the location of the access\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: the gable vent at the end closest to the access needs to be meshed. Recommend recommending a gable fan for ventilation and brand new insulation.	7015.39	6313.85	0.00	2025-08-04 18:35:02.897	2025-06-16 17:39:19.636	2025-08-01 13:52:02.658-03	2025-08-18 08:40:25.372-03	\N	\N

He’s friendly and easy to work with, but when communicating with him, please be courteous and concise, and stick to the facts. He’s very analytical and appreciates clarity over storytelling. There’s a driveway next to his home that we can park in. For the vacuum hose, it can either run through the home or, preferably, through the window that leads directly into the room with attic access—this is the shorter and more efficient path. Please note that due to the material used for his roof—metal shingles—it will not be safe to walk on, as the panels can bend or be damaged. We will need to bring very tall ladders for the exterior rodent proofing. Jim has built some wooden steps that help distribute weight safely on the roof, but they only allow access to a small area, so ideally we can complete the work without stepping on the roof at all by using the window hose route.\n\nThis project will be broken into three phases with a QC visit after the first. Phase one includes the full removal of old materials, sanitation, and rodent proofing. Phase two will follow, and phase three will consist of installing roughly 90% of the insulation. We will not be installing insulation above the kitchen at this time, as Jim has an upcoming electrical and lighting project planned. I’ve already confirmed with Matt that our team will return at a later date to install insulation in that section once the electrical work is complete. Jim has been very particular about insulation materials and where everything is being installed, so it’s important that the project lead reaches out to me (PM Nathan Woods) prior to the start date to review all the details. I’ve included notes in the proposal, but a direct conversation will help ensure everyone is aligned.\n\nBecause the project is being split into phases, the customer has agreed to pay up to 90% of the project total after phase two, with the remaining 10% to be paid after the final insulation is installed over the kitchen. For scheduling, please note that they will have a guest in town and be hosting a family reunion between July 14th and 18th, so no work can be performed during that time. If possible, please schedule phase one for Monday, July 21st, QC for Wednesday the 23rd, and phase two for Friday the 25th. It is very important that there is at least a 48-hour window between each step—this was a major part of what helped close the project, and the customer will be alarmed if we don’t follow this timeline. Again, both Jim and his wife are very kind people. His wife is a retired teacher and received our educator discount as a thank-you for her service. Let me know if you have any questions and please confirm once the project has been scheduled.	9086.90	8178.21	0.00	2025-06-28 19:18:58.512	2025-06-19 00:59:25.524	2025-08-01 13:52:09.26-03	2025-08-18 08:40:28.621-03	\N	\N

One to the right in the utility room and the second to the left of the front door in the hallway. Crawlspace access is in the backyard.\n\nBuilding Details:\nSingle story. There have been several rounds of home renovations done with more on the way. The smaller attic accessible through the utility room will require extensive rodent proofing. There is 12 sq ft of nailed down plywood to remove with blown in cotton insulation beneath it. There is also insulation and debris in gaps at the outer perimeter of the attic floor by the walls that need to be vacuumed out and rodent proofed. Most rodent activity is by the electrical and plumbing where the two attics meet. \n\n***We will install an additional 200sq ft of R30 rockwool batting in the floor of the small attic closest to the attic hatch for the customer to store items on the rafters. Approved by Tyson. (AT and BT state 100sq ft, we offered to do an additional 200ft rockwool here instead of cellulose at same price)***\n\nThe larger attic has a whole house fan. We will use rockwool underneath to keep dust to a minimum. Spot vac droppings and any debris. HEAVY sanitize and fog in all attics.\n\nCrawlspace has multiple screens with holes. Air seal and inspect electrical. Be CAREFUL of hanging wires in the crawlspace. I snagged a fiber optic line and took out their internet, so watch out for that thin wire. RP, air seal and heavy on sanitizing.\n\nCustomer Profile:\nThomas is very calm and cautious of people who do half-assed work. He appreciates professionalism and communication. Keep him informed of the work being done and the progress being made and he’ll be happy.\n\nHis daughter is very sensitive to mold and chemicals. She will be gone during our work. She will be nervous about the dust from the cellulose and the RMR smell. Be thorough in setup and that will put Thomas at ease who will keep the rest of the family secure. Wife is Victoria and she is very kind but standoffish. She’s having Thomas take care of everything.\n\nObstructions and Hazards: \nThey recently had asbestos ducting abated in the attics. The whole attic has been largely cleaned out aside from the debris mentioned above. The attic was treated with an aerosolized glue to lock in asbestos fibers. Thomas is worried about any asbestos fibers lifted during our vacuuming but also understands the debris is minimal. \n\nSpecialty Jobs / Final Thoughts:\nEngage Thomas during your install of the rockwool in the small attic. Ask him about the placement for his storage use so he feels at ease and in control. Blow in cellulose for all the other areas and pack those wall gaps so the rats in the walls can’t get in anywhere.\n\nCustom crawlspace door.\n\n*3% cash discount\n	8658.48	7792.63	0.00	2025-08-08 12:49:43.775	2025-06-26 13:13:53.343	2025-08-01 13:52:09.31-03	2025-08-18 08:40:24.84-03	\N	\N

Access through Front door, 20 foot set up. Hose through front window / or garage. \n\nBUILDING DETAILS:—- There’s a difference between attic SF and Insulation SF. Reason is there’s a little bit of the garage attic access in attic, and some of the covered front porch. Those sections currently do not have insulation. We do not need to install insulation in those areas. There is a vaulted section, it’s a pretty small slope. I didn’t want to complicate things, so just blow it in. Batting R-19 is for pony wall. There’s a rigid duct in attic full of feces. Insulation needs replaced. \n\nCUSTOMER PROFILE: —-Nice man, has a phobia of rats. Absolutely hates them and they’ve been scratching at his ceiling above the bed. He hasn’t been able to sleep. Has a surgery coming up, had to lose about 60lbs for it. He’s a family man, asked if his 22 year old son can come to work for us. \n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS: For RP, get a guy on roof. There’s a part in the front of the house that has a kind of dormer where 2 pitch changes meet, I believe there are entry points there. \n\nOUT OF ORIGINARY / FINAL THOUGHTS: — There’s a rigid dryer duct that came apart. We need to fix it / re attach it with screws. And mastic tape. 	9882.25	8795.21	0.00	2025-08-07 10:52:04.227	2025-07-21 20:19:36.536	2025-08-01 13:52:06.552-03	2025-08-18 08:40:24.922-03	\N	\N

We will also be replacing his 16 inch insulated flex duct, furnace return, and the fan ductwork from his laundry room. Everything else is pretty straightforward. No need for set up, we can pull our truck right up to the garage and work from there.

Customer is aware that power will be turned off during work days. Also, please remind Ron during scheduling that we need the trees on the side of his home, trimmed back in order to accurately assess what rodent proofing is necessary along the side of his roof.   CREW NOTES: Ron is the owner of the property, he’s really nice guy born and raised in West Seattle. His parents grew up in South Seattle so he has a close connection to Seattle in multiple different ways for multiple generations. His daughter and soon-to-be son-in-law just moved into his rental property, which was The one I inspected. There’s a driveway that we have access to that gets you about 20 feet from the back door, which is about 5 feet from the closet entrance to the attic. Ron‘s daughter has two dogs, they’re both very friendly and hyperactive, not dangerous, but please do make sure that they are behind the gate or in a closed room when going in or out of the house..There was evidence of current rodent activity, failing ductwork, allowing humid air to get into his attic and insufficient insulation. We will be doing full scope RP3 and mold remediation (it was difficult for me to tell if the discoloration was actually mold. The customers do not have high expectations for roof decking coloring to change much with mold remediation, this was more of a preventative measure since the dryer vent was pumping humid air into their attic space). His daughter and soon-to-be son-in-law are getting married mid July, they’re hoping to have this project tackled before then hopefully the first week of July or sooner.

Mio is from Panama originally and speaks fluent Spanish, her husband is from North Carolina. They met here in Washington. Her husband is really nice down to earth guy, had the privilege of chatting with him for a while to give you some insights on fatherhood and marriage. Mio runs a daycare out of her home, which is why they gave us a call to see if we could help with this rodent remediation project. The other crawlspace, renovated two or three years ago by pest control company, but unfortunately, it did not come with any guarantees or warranties. They are excited about the idea of investing in a project that is covered by their company and guaranteed to be supported for the next 10 years. There seems to be plenty of parking in front of their home. The crawlspace is low, I would recommend sending in a small team. We are going to be removing and sanitizing the entire crawlspace with RP3 and warranty. There is a significant amount of rigid duct that has insulation that needs to be removed and replaced, please take a look while you’re removing the insulation to make sure there’s no breaches in the ductwork, they did have a HVAC company come and run video camera cameras down into the ductwork to see if there was any rodents or droppings currently in there which they didn’t find any of. (WE SHOULD INTEGRATE THIS INTO OUR INSPECTION TO HELP SHOW THE SEVERITY OF RODENT INFESTATION AND HOW THEY CAN AFFECT THE DUCTWORK.) The customer is hoping to have the project completed as soon as possible, we gave her tentative ETA around the week of July 14 through the 18th, but she understands that this project has to go through a couple different steps before a start date can be approved. Crawlspace door is very small and may need some additional latches to keep it sealed tight, along with some additional rodent proofing. Please reach out to PM Nathan Woods with any questions, I’m happy to help.

We need someone here that can communicate very well with this customer because she is the type to not just let everyone work. She will be asking questions about every single little thing. Very detail oriented. She use to manage construction so she is familiar with general construction. Wants everything done perfectly. If it gets to a point to where you feel it’s too much call me and I’ll give her a call to help and answer questions. \n\nSpecial job notes \n-there are 20 crawlspace vents. This seems to be how the rodents are getting into the space. Seal these very well. \n-there is a duct that is disconnected. Bring a big zip tie and tape to reconnect it to the system. \n\n	12908.20	10971.97	0.00	2025-08-06 12:14:24.976	2025-07-15 19:37:49.408	2025-08-01 13:52:07.048-03	2025-08-18 08:40:25.096-03	\N	\N

Attic area for the most part is above four feet in height, there’s one section about 350 ft.². That is a belly crawl, there’s another section where the garage was made into an addition that has fiberglass insulation of another 330 ft.². Crawlspace under the house about 1600 ft.² in size. Heavy rodent infestation, heavy debris, rafter attic. Crawlspace has fecal matter throughout and dead rodents. Wiring in attic is suspect open junction boxes and some wiring that needs to be put into junction boxes.\n\nCustomer profile: older couple with adult children at home. Nice dog. Mother is not happy with the rodents at all.\n\nObstacles/hazards: the attic is 1950s construction has cross memes a little bit difficult to move around in. That one section that is 330 ft.² as a belly crawl that would be difficult. Crawlspace is pretty used to get around it.\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: pretty straightforward\n\nThe original proposal was modified to make this a phase 1 only.

Access to crawlspace is on left-hand side of the house exterior access. Access to attic is on second floor in one of the bedrooms. The access hatch to the attic is very small. The stairs going from the first floor to the second floor are original to the home built in 1910 so very steep.\n\nCUSTOMER PROFILE: two sisters own and live in the house together. Both are retired. Very very nice ladies that will ask lots and lots of questions :-). Treat them like queens, please.\n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS: crawlspace is going to be extremely difficult. Very old home so rodent proofing will have to be interior/exterior. My assumption is you will need to use a large amount of concrete in the crawlspace interior/exterior.\n\nThe crawlspace is very shallow. A little tough to move around in there. There are recesses dug around the perimeter of the crawlspace as well as some going down the middle of the space. Just to give you enough room to go from area to area. The vapor barrier is going to have to be fished from one side to the next in order to get it stretched out. \n\nOUT OF ORDINARY / FINAL THOUGHTS: there is an additional day added into the proposal for the difficult maneuverability in the crawlspace.	19292.29	15433.83	0.00	2025-08-05 15:48:42.386	2025-07-23 22:58:49.354	2025-08-07 22:50:15.735-03	2025-08-18 08:40:25.281-03	\N	\N

Homeowner will secure the spot in front of the house on the street. This is a better access to the home.. Attic access is in the front room 15 feet from the front door. They have an attic ladder.\n\nBuilding details: 960 ft.² ranch home, built in the 30s. Crawlspace underneath the entirety. However, access in the attic is only for 700 ft.² of the home. There may be an attic above the addition, but I did not see a way to get to it from The main attic area. A couple of the vents in the crawlspace are open. There’s a couple holes in the attic as well. Moderate rodent activity. New HVAC system.\n\nCustomer profile: Jamie and her wife can’t sleep due to the noise in the attic. They are also customers that were referred by a customer of mine. Mentioned that in the winter months, the house does not stay warm. They have a dog named Wally. Doesn’t bark, very timid.\n\nObstacles and hazards: even though this attic is not a trust attic, they built the rafters with cross beams that are very similar. There is about 230 ft.² of pretty low attic space not a belly crawl but not 4 feet in height. Crawlspace is fairly easy move around.\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: no rodent activity in the crawlspace, however let’s road and improve it anyways and sanitize it	6581.02	5922.92	0.00	2025-07-25 21:38:51.533	2025-06-30 17:46:50.442	2025-08-01 13:52:06.092-03	2025-08-18 08:40:27.327-03	\N	\N

Crawlspace access is underneath the deck.\n\nParking and access: parking is in the driveway. Access to the crawlspace is under the deck in the back.\n\nBuilding details: 4200 square-foot ranch home in La Jolla. The crawlspace is broken into about three sections. One section is underneath an old garage which is now a bedroom. There’s insulation and that’s about 300 ft.². Another section is inaccessible at this point And is about 600 ft.². The balance which I believe is about 3000 square feet is accessible. Some parts are tight for the most part though you can move around in. The access to the crawlspace is very small. The crawlspace is filled with trash. And there’s mold in a considerable amount of it, especially as you head towards the back. Round activity in the front.\n\nCustomer profile: customer closed on the house about two days ago. Looking to get things in order, however concerned about the amount of repairs that the home needs. \n\nObstacle/hazards: the entry to the crawlspace is definitely a obstacle. There’s also a lot of pipes in some areas that are very difficult in the crawlspace.\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: we have to figure out a way to get ventilation into the back part of the home. The crawlspace under the far addition has no ventilation whatsoever. That will lead to mold in the subfloor failing.	14919.26	11935.40	0.00	2025-07-29 21:53:50.409	2025-07-23 22:30:46.532	2025-08-01 13:52:04.367-03	2025-08-18 08:40:26.501-03	\N	\N

There are two attics on each side of the great room. There is an attic above the great room, but we will not be doing anything there as it is very difficult to get around in it. The attic to the left of the entry is about 350 ft.² not including the sloped area. I’ve included the sloped area in the removal of the insulation, but not in the re-insulation. Very hot up there. There is an HVAC system in each area. Light rounded activity blown in insulation in the smaller attic. To the left is the larger of the two attic. This one is about 450 ft.² not including the slope area. Same as the first attic, we will be pulling from the slope area, but not re-insulating into it. Light rodent activity there as well. Sanitize both attic spaces to remove the light mold on the. Rafters.\n\nObstacles/hazards: both attics are tight and hard to get around in. Try to get this one done early. It is hot there.\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: this is a return customer.

Straight shot from the curb to the front door. Attic access is in the hallway that is about 20-30ft from the front door. \n2. Building Details: Attic was just redone 8 months ago and they are still having a problem. Once in the attic it is fairly easy to move in. Be careful of the joists until you clear a path from the cellulose. The attic is a lone rectangle with a rear cut out. Look for the ply wood to climb through. \n3. Customer Profile: Roger and his wife are really nice. They are pretty bummed about not having the problem fixed by the last company. They are big football fans so you can bring that up if you want. \n4. Obstructions and Hazards: There aren’t too many obstacles here accept what I mentioned above.  \n5. Specialty Jobs / Final Thoughts: For the most part, this is pretty straightforward. The ducts I noticed damaged are in the rear section you have to climb into and one duct that leads out of the area.

Parking and Access: Parking will be on the street in front with a long run to the front door. The attic hatch is down the hallway near the bathroom. Good sized hatch. She does have a lot of personal items in the house so set up may be minimal to navigate this.\n2. Building Details: This is a one story home with a pretty big attic. This attic is HOT with a lot of ducting and debris. It has a few types of insulation as well. There are wood planks in the attic that are loose. They run with the hoists so do not trust them to be sturdy. I would move all of them to the hvac Landon so it is easier to walk. Once inside the attic though it is not too bad to move in with some good height to work in. \n3. Customer Profile: Vicky is pretty interesting. She is very nice but direct. I was very thorough with her on the scope of work to save any questions day of the job. \n4. Obstructions and Hazards: There aren’t too many obstacles here accept what I mentioned above. \n5. Specialty Jobs / Final Thoughts: For the most part, this is pretty straightforward with above mentioned with a lot of tedious RP. Some of the main points of entry were the ac lines and a big cut out in the boxed soffit where pipes go in. She did deal with a raccoon in the attic recently so make sure all exterior rp is very strong if we can’t seal from inside the attic space.

The dogs are very friendly and like to play, they’ll be inside in their kennels or away from the house while the work is being done.Their home is at the end of a roundabout, parking may be a little difficult if both of them are home and their driveway is full. They signed up for flex scheduling, since our team can have access to the crawlspace without being home, so feel free to move them forward if need be. The original call came in due to rodents getting underneath their bay window, which was constructed on top of a concrete slab. There’s no access to the area underneath the bay window from the crawlspace. Josh and myself came up with a plan, well it was 100% Josh, but I trust him., to install painters tape around the base of the bay window, trim to protect it, and then to install painters tape on the existing concrete slab and then to pour concrete under the bay window to create a barrier of concrete that rodents can’t get by, please touch base with Josh if you have any questions about this process. The area beneath the bay window will not have a warranty, but the crawlspace will be completely cleared out and have a warranty after we do a standard RP3 JOB W/ QC. You will see that some new pink insulation was installed underneath their kitchen. This will be removed and replaced. The reason why there’s new insulation here is because they had a slow water leak that damaged all the insulation underneath there kitchen and created some dry rot in the structure and there subfloor. Electrical 123 is in there just in case you see any gnawing on wiring, I did not see any damage, but please wrap any wires that have been exposed. Again, both these folks are very friendly and nice. Feel free to chat with them and show interest in their awesome dogs. If everything goes smoothly with the bay window rodent proofing, and the RP three job in their crawlspace, feel free to ask them for a review and mention to include Nathan Woods, the team lead, and any other crew members that worked on the project, if you do not feel comfortable requesting a review feel free to touch base with PM Nathan Woods and I will reach out.

Until you get around the bend and go towards the plumbing there you’ll find the little patch of mold. We will also be air ceiling underneath the furnace. Air seal in between all of the subfloor cracks. Sanitize the rest. \n\nCustomer profile: customer is a DIY type of person. Concerned about mold. Pretty nice fella.\n\nObstacle/hazards: there are some rocks in the crawlspace. It’ll make the vapor barrier flat difficult. And as I said before, some of the crawlspace is tight.\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: the air ceiling under the furnace closet is very key.	3700.00	3700.00	0.00	2025-07-28 18:18:40.092	2025-07-27 23:21:37.45	2025-08-01 13:52:04.995-03	2025-08-18 08:40:26.782-03	\N	\N

Julian was sent to sell his house, the buyer inspected the property and found rodent activity in the attic, got their own proposal to make a counter offer, I did my inspection and with the help of Brandon and Tyson, was able to price match the competitor. Pretty straightforward mold remediation and RP3 with 10 year warranty. We will be installing six new roof vents and blocking the existing Gables to create better airflow. There is a steep driveway that we can park our truck on, bring extra hose for vacuuming out, 40ft run from the driveway to the attic hatch. I am unsure if the current homeowners will be home during this project, they did provide me with a door code (5040) for my initial inspection but please confirm with them how they would like us to enter the building. Please reach out to PM Nathan Woods with any additional questions.OPPS: this is a real estate project and the customer will need finished photos sent to them as soon as possible.

It does have a shared wall on both sides so we will need to do some good rp in the attic. I noticed the main entrance was the ac lines though.

He does not like “showmanship” as much as competence.\n\nObstructions And Hazards: He’s blind so expect a few odd things here and there, sometimes objects are used as touch points so you may see something in a walkway, do not move the furniture around.

Much easier location is a couple feet away in the hallway. There is electric at both furnaces. The gable fan should go where there is currently a horn attached to the gable vent. The horn will have to be removed. They do not use it.

You might be able to park the truck. If not, you’ll have to do street parking in front of the house. There’s a little bit of a downgrade going towards the house from the driveway. Really nice young couple. The attic entrance is right inside the front door to your right and then immediate left. There is a bedroom with a large attic entrance in the closet easy access. Very short set up. There are a lot of rat droppings in the attic. There is no insulation. So we need to vacuum all of the droppings, heavy sanitize, then we are going to install the second to smallest size full house man stealth pro 4.8 X when you look in the hallway that’s adjacent to this bedroom you’ll see a hallway light.

The crawlspace access is right in the garage 5 feet from the end of the inside of the driveway. Paul just bought this house and the inspection did not reveal the rodent problem. There is a discontinued duct in a chimney in the crawlspace And from the outside I do not see where it goes, but it looks like there’s been traffic from rodents coming through there. We will need steel mesh and probably some concrete to rodent proof that area. I also found a couple of holes underneath the foundation which we will need concrete for rodent proofing. They’re also seems to be a gap between the subfloor and the sill plate that may need steel mesh around the perimeter. There is a slight freshwater plumbing leak and a half inch of water in and 8‘ x 4‘ low spot near where the water leak is. Obviously does not need to be pumped as it’s too shallow and they are going to fix it while we do the quality control or before we do the quality control check. Please call me if you have any questions Patrick at 425–8 70–6417 thank you for your great work!	17016.21	17016.21	0.00	2025-07-04 15:56:19.011	2025-06-25 18:21:33.306	2025-08-01 13:52:08.809-03	2025-08-18 08:40:28.41-03	\N	\N

I believe she's moving to Scotland or Ireland in the next couple months so she's trying to get her house ready to go on the market. Had a great conversation. She's really nice to chat with. She has a corgi dog, I believe, but they are typically in doggy daycare during the weekdays. We're doing a full clean out our P3 job on her medium size side attic, and a partial job, just removal and replacement of vapor barrier with some rodent proofing in the crawl. Please do your best to make sure rodent droppings, especially around the entrance of both the attic, and the crawlspace have been thoroughly removed. We wanna make sure that no red flags pop up during the pre-inspection. A point of concern and interest that should be focused on is Set up, touch base with Candace to determine the best route for the team. She will go by our judgment, but did have concerns about accessibility given that the clean pathway practically splits the house in half, her husband works in the office in the back where there's a bathroom, but she most likely would be hanging out towards the front of the house. She wants to make sure that there is an access point for her to get from the front of the house to the back of the house and vice versa for her husband. There is access to the basement through a downstairs door that she may want us to use for entering and exiting rather than through her back door. Street parking may be very difficult depending on the time of the day, there is a narrow driveway behind her house that the truck may fit on, otherwise allocate some time to find street parking. Please reach out to PM Nathan Woods with any questions. Please reach out to Nathan Woods on the last day of the project via telegram text to let me know how things have gone so I can reach out to request a review.

The entire attic needs to be treated. —There is evidence of very little prior rodent activity, I don’t believe it’s active.

I believe she’s moving to Scotland or Ireland in the next couple months so she’s trying to get her house ready to go on the market. Had a great conversation. She’s really nice to chat with. She has a corgi dog, I believe, but they are typically in doggy daycare during the weekdays. We’re doing a full clean out our P3 job on her medium size side attic, and a partial job, just removal and replacement of vapor barrier with some rodent proofing in the crawl. Please do your best to make sure rodent droppings, especially around the entrance of both the attic, and the crawlspace have been thoroughly removed. We wanna make sure that no red flags pop up during the pre-inspection. A point of concern and interest that should be focused on is Set up, touch base with Candace to determine the best route for the team. She will go by our judgment, but did have concerns about accessibility given that the clean pathway practically splits the house in half, her husband works in the office in the back where there’s a bathroom, but she most likely would be hanging out towards the front of the house. She wants to make sure that there is an access point for her to get from the front of the house to the back of the house and vice versa for her husband. There is access to the basement through a downstairs door that she may want us to use for entering and exiting rather than through her back door. Street parking may be very difficult depending on the time of the day, there is a narrow driveway behind her house that the truck may fit on, otherwise allocate some time to find street parking. Please reach out to PM Nathan Woods with any questions. Please reach out to Nathan Woods on the last day of the project via telegram text to let me know how things have gone so I can reach out to request a review.

The street was kinda busy when I was there but you may be able to park right in front of the of his driveway. This job consists of the crawlspace only. There are two access points. There is a big door in the garage and another hatch the left of the front door. Each hatch will get you to all of the crawl space but I would use both to access the different sections. \n2. Building Details: The issue has been on going in the crawl space. Dennis has tried his best to seal things but he can’t find where they are getting in still. The crawl space is fairly easy to move in. It has a few different sections with this alleyway down the center. \n3. Customer Profile: Dennis is an interesting guy who is a talker. He wants to be done with the rodents and despite his efforts they still get in. I was able to find a main entry so he decided to hire us out of confidence. He will check all of our work meticulously so be aware of this. He will get in the crawlspace. \n4. Obstructions and Hazards: There aren’t too many obstacles here accept what I mentioned above.  \n5. Specialty Jobs / Final Thoughts: For the most part, this is pretty straightforward. Dennis’s has sealed a bunch of areas. Our primary if the foundation. I found an old pipe that was hidden by the wall near a crawl vent so sealing under the foundation edge is very important. I would bring some concrete screws to attach the mesh to the crawl vents to the block walls. There are also two closets on either side of the garage that we need to tighten up. In the big crawl area with the big drop down, there are to openings where duct and pipes come through. Please screen these off. All in all, take your time and seal any little thing  you see. I did not offer a warranty on this so he is expecting us to really lock this down for him. If you have any questions feel free to reach out.

We’re gonna be installing a smart attic fan and there will be a need for an electrician to install an outlet. Her proposal does not include electrical, will be sending her information to Have an electrician reach out. She’s going to purchase a camera online that I have agreed for our team to plug into the outlet. Any additional outside the scope of plugging in the camera into the outlet will need to be reviewed for additional time. There’s also a fair amount of mold that needs to be addressed. There’s a driveway that we should be able to go up to back out the insulation. There are two out of catches one about 15 feet from the front door and another one in the bathroom towards the back of the house. Bring additional vacuum tubing for the attic hatch that’s further away if you think that’s more convenient for backing out. She seems like a really nice lady, treat her with respect. I don’t know if she’s gonna be too interested in hearing the steps of the project but if she seems to be hanging around then feel free to give her information about what we’re doing. Feel free to reach out to PM Nathan Woods with any questions. 	14870.15	12639.63	0.00	2025-07-15 15:32:15.15	2025-07-14 22:16:37.184	2025-08-01 13:52:07.138-03	2025-08-18 08:40:27.694-03	\N	\N

They have a ton of cars in the driveway so apologies for the longer hike. You may be able to stage snake bags on the front lawn just be careful of mess because it’s artificial turf. Access to the attic is in the upstairs master closet. Good size hatch. Marie will be working on clearing a better path to the hatch for us. \n2. Building Details: This is a two story home with no crawl. The attic once inside is pretty easy to move around in for the most part. It has good clearance as well. I’d plan for a longer run of hose though if we can stage safely in the front of the house. The garage also has a major rat issue. They have been told this is on them to get things cleared out and she is going to hire some to get rid of the junk. We will seal around the water heater pipes though. You can see where they get into the wall. I am unsure of the garage attic but if you are able to get inside to seal anything that would be good but I don’t think it links to the main attic. \n3. Customer Profile: This is Marie’s parents house and they need this done for their parents. The rats have taken over. They are looking forward to getting the work done. The parents are slightly hard of hearing so keep that in mind. Marie will be our main point of contact. \n4. Obstructions and Hazards: There aren’t too many obstacles here accept what I mentioned above. \n5. Specialty Jobs / Final Thoughts: For the most part, this is pretty straightforward with above mentioned. Please reach out with any questions. \n	11898.55	10946.66	0.00	2025-07-10 18:08:27.603	2025-07-10 16:09:29.493	2025-08-01 13:52:07.501-03	2025-08-18 08:40:27.848-03	\N	\N

Also very nice. They have a four month old name Paisley should be easy to work with.\n\n\nThe most important thing to these homeowners is that the job is done properly they have been dealing with the extreme heat. They don’t have much insulation in our attic, so they really want to see results all besides, that pictures would be great during the job.\n\n\nObstructions and Hazards:\n\n\nJob should be pretty basic. Only tough parts are gonna be again when you come into the attic to the right side until left side there’s a little bit harder to remove the existing batting order. Besides, that should be a straightforward job.\n\n\nSpecialty Jobs / Final Thoughts:\n\n\nHe’s a really nice people.

We need to seal the one, but the other one has a fan on it and we are not sealing that obviously.Both areas together are 1264 ft.². In the attic there is a blue hose that is connected to. I do not know what so I don’t know what to do with it. It’s probably a discontinued line or something. It’s not dumping any water or anything into the attic. We also need to close the gable vents With a piece of paper or whatever it is we use because it is interrupting the ventilation from the bottom to the top. They’re both very accessible and it seems like it could be done in one day. Two different projects obviously but that is the square footage all together. John and his wife are really concerned because they are getting sick all the time and his wife is a doctor and their child has been getting sick a lot so they’re trying to eliminate any kind of bad air from the crawlspace and attic and clean everything up really nicely.

No pets in the house. Main concern is removing asbestos. She called us out because of weak air flow, found asbestos ducts so now that is priority #1.  Capping off vent registers for now, and she will do ducts toward end of year with us. Had to break it up for financial reasons. \n\n\nObstructions and Hazards: attic is easy to get around in, no trusses, the usual roofing nails to look out for though.

Guest parking is available approximately 20 feet from the front door.\n\nBUILDING DETAILS:\nThis is a two-story townhome. The unit is Unit A, with Unit B located directly next door.\n\nCUSTOMER PROFILE:\nSivan and her husband, Ryan, are both friendly and professional. They appear to work from home in the tech industry. They have a 2.5-year-old daughter and are eager to address the mold issue as soon as possible. A mold remediation company hired by their HOA treated the space about three years ago, but the mold has since returned. They’re now looking to update their ventilation system in addition to completing the remediation work.\n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS:\nThe Attic has an area with low clearance, be sure to bring plywood boards to lay on and to help maneuver foggers and other mold remediation equipment.\n\nOUT OF THE ORDINARY / FINAL THOUGHTS:\nThe customer has a dog that was in the backyard during the visit. While they’ve stated the dog is friendly, please ensure doors remain closed to prevent the dog from entering the house and accidentally getting out the front door. Also, since there is a young child in the home, it’s important that the setup is done carefully and safely.	7431.54	5945.23	0.00	2025-08-15 19:53:44.971	2025-08-05 17:50:28.252	2025-08-07 09:18:08.809-03	2025-08-18 08:40:21.498-03	sivanso1714@gmail.com	206-288-3227

So Bring extra hose. \n\nBUILDING DETAILS:—-This is an old ass house with lots of old, open wire Knob and Tube. Cut power to the home. This is a mix out. There’s batting insulation, with a bunch of news paper crap on the bottom, plus 1 room with blown in cellulose. \n\nCUSTOMER PROFILE:—- Strange couple, good sense of humor. They want to take good care of their old ass home. \n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS:—- There’s a lot of small debris that need to be removed. The attic entrance is very very small, so we need small people. There’s also a small room that (I currently have included in SF) has cellulose blown in, I’m not sure if we need to physically get a body in there or not to vac out, mold remediate and blow in. But It’s currently not accessible, some framing slats will need to be cut to get in there. Let me know your thoughts and I’ll add hours as needed. Again to clarify, this room is already included in SF. \n\nOUT OF ORDINARY / FINAL THOUGHTS:—-There’s a side attic at the top of the stairs. We’re not doing anything in there. —We are also installing an attic fan on the right side of the home if you’re looking at it from the street. This is a wired attic fan. We are installing #2 roof vents as well down toward the bottom of the eves to act as intake. 1 in the back of the attic, 1 on far left side. Roof is a bit dangerous because of slope. I was up there 15 mins with no problems. 	11444.24	10643.15	0.00	2025-08-15 19:53:25.02	2025-07-17 22:04:18.076	2025-08-01 13:52:03.457-03	2025-08-18 08:40:21.527-03	\N	\N

You can park in the driveway to the crawlspace. You may want to park around the corner in the back and use the back door because the access is in the basement. The homeowner is elderly, and she called us out for a squirrel that’s getting into the attic in the voltage section of her living room due to an access point on the exterior of the house on both sides of the chimney. We are going to need to rodent proof around the chimney from the exterior of the house, in addition to the rodent proofing from the interior of the attic space. There’s also an access in the crawlspace in the corner, where you can see daylight to the outside..

Both attic and Crawlspace entrances are interior. Both entrances are tight, so are the spaces.\n\nBUILDING DETAILS:—- 12” crawlspace, there’s an area on the far side that is 20” The entire floor is concrete, so there shouldn’t be any burrowing. —- Attic space is also difficult. It’s less than 2 feet tall, all batting insulation. Should bring some plywood or planks to make it easier to get around. \n\nCUSTOMER PROFILE: —— Very upbeat mom, she is very nice. They like us because of our professionalism and knowing how to get this done correctly. I did not meet the husband. They are a family of faith. 2 wild kids, would be a good idea to take a coloring book or 2. \n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS:—— The crawlspace is 12” so have fun. ——One side of the attic has very long extended eves, might need a hook to fish out some of the insulation, the expectation is that we will not be able to remove all of it. ——To get up to the roof, we’ll need to ladder onto the garage, then small ladder up to main roof. \n\nOUT OF ORIGINARY / FINAL THOUGHTS: —- This project seems very difficult, however both spaces are 400sf or less.

Our focus will be the little hall avenue and where it opens up past the quiet cool fan. We will be running the storage down that path and connecting it to the open area with the yellow insulation. We are batting put all where the storage will go and also the one wall with yellow insulation. \n3. Customer Profile: Ben and Julia are really nice and excited to have some useable space in the attic. They have a little 8 month old so be good on the setup to protect their house. \n4. Obstructions and Hazards: There aren’t too many obstacles here accept what I mentioned above.\n5.

The vapor barrier will be going on the wall on the right as you climb the attic ladder, the two walls down the hall of the attic and the one wall where it opens up to the larger storage area. We will also be installing a dedicated circuit for their attic light with a switch in the attic. It currently runs off the whole house fan circuit.

Otherwise, both the attic and crawlspace are fairly large and accessible.\n\n⸻\n\nOUT OF ORDINARY / FINAL THOUGHTS:\nOne bathroom fan is venting into the attic and out through a roof vent incorrectly. We’ll replace the current duct with a 4” insulated flex duct. Due to the faux cedar shake roofing, we may not be able to install a flapper. Due to this, we may have to do our best to seal the new ductwork to the roof vent until a third-party roofing company can install a proper flat vent. The customer understands this will be a temporary solution, and once a roofer installs a proper vent, we’ll return to connect the duct.\nAttic has varying R-values in the walls and vaulted ceilings.

Attic entrance is in the hallway about 40 feet from the front door. There are two crawlspace entrances on each side. They open up to small 5 foot wide 32 foot long sections of the crawlspace is these were both added to the original home. The original home crawlspace entrance is inside one of the Other crawlspace entrances and it is blocked by a dryer vent at the moment. \n\nBuilding details: in the main attic which is about 1400 ft.² there is a mix of cellulose and old fiberglass batting with the foil back. There’s also some blown in newer fiberglass in one corner and then there’s about 100 ft.² of batting in this Area off of the main attic that’s about 100 ft.². No debris to speak of. Light rodent infestation. There is two asbestos pipes and about six possible asbestos boots.There is insulation in one section of the crawlspace. Runs are in it. We didn’t check the other section of the crawlspace. But we are going to assume there’s insulation there and we are going to remove it as well.\n\nCustomer profile: Cindy is tired of the mice. Bill is a DIY type a guy. Installed his own solar. Does a lot of work around the house. But he is older now. So he may be interested in having us do at least the first phase.

The attic part which we are having problems of is off the master bedroom. It is floored everything seems to be screwed down. There is a lot of personal items in that 780 ft.² that they may want moved by our guys. Rodents are coming through the walls coming in through the roof. The crawlspace, which is only about 600 ft.² was clear of any road activity. Most of the crawlspace you cannot get to it is inaccessible. Access to the crawl is in the closet on the first floor.

Most of it is easy enough to get to. There is some plumbing in the way in certain parts. There is rat feces Sporadically around a couple of the foundation peers. There’s one big bear crap in the far corner. There’s moderate amount of debris around the edges. And there’s mold around the plumbing. \n\nCustomer profile: I met with Hugh her husband. This house was inhabited by a bear. He got into the crawlspace to try to get out of the heat did some plumbing damage and left a present in the far corner. They fixed the plumbing damage and they’re waiting for a bear proof crawlspace door. They also had Terminix do the rodent proofing.  \n\nObstacles and hazards: the plumbing is in the way.\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: adding a T8 crawlspace fan to the left of the entrance looking into the crawlspace. There’s some Romax right there should be an easy install. The moisture levels in the crawlspace are just above what’s allowed.

The roofer is coming to install two bathroom vents on the roof so we will be attaching the hoses from the interior of the attic.\n\nOUT OF ORDINARY/ FINAL THOUGHTS: client is having his own electrician come out and wire an outlet for the attic fan. Attic fan should be located somewhat close to the attic entry so that I can exhaust the vaulted atic and open space.	11424.65	10853.42	0.00	2025-08-11 14:33:19.209	2025-07-15 17:36:46.702	2025-08-01 13:52:04.068-03	2025-08-18 08:40:24.615-03	\N	\N
8919	Nick Avgeres - SEA	9	4	7	4729.49	17.00	70.61	8886	Nick  Avgeres	4121 Midvale Ave N, Seattle, WA 98103	Nick and his wife have lived in their home for about eight years. I had the pleasure of meeting Nick—he works in marketing, is concise with his words, and holds an upbeat conversation. They have three cats that may attempt to slip out if doors are left open. On project day, check in with Nick to confirm the cats are secured in a room, as the front door will likely be open and closed frequently during setup and cleanup. Street parking should work fine. Be sure to bring extra vacuum hose—approximately 30 feet from the curb to the front door, plus an additional 30 feet to reach the attic hatch.\n\nWhen Nick and his wife bought the house, they waived the home inspection due to market conditions at the time. The attic currently has exhaust vents but no intake vents, with no soffit vents or bird blocks, which has led to poor airflow and mold growth. Our initial call was regarding possible rodent activity. I found evidence of a large nesting area, possibly raccoon, along with minimal smaller rodent droppings, likely squirrel or rat.\n\nThe project scope includes mold remediation, rodent proofing, and ventilation upgrades. To address the lack of ventilation, we will install additional roof vents near the roof’s edge to act as intake vents, as there is no room for soffit vent installation—please reference the attached photo. We will also be installing a smart attic fan to create forced airflow and reduce the likelihood of mold returning. This is an RP3 rodent proofing and mold remediation job with ventilation improvements. Please reach out to PM Nathan Woods with any questions, happy to help.	12296.67	10206.24	0.00	2025-08-12 14:27:24.506	2025-07-16 22:01:27.564	2025-08-01 13:52:04.676-03	2025-08-18 08:40:24.53-03	\N	\N

Attic access is in the hallway.\n\nBuilding details: the main part of the home is about 1150 ft.² of ranch. There is a back building that we are not going to be dealing with. The attic is about the same size 1150 ft.² tall enough trusses in the attic. Rolled in fiberglass insulation with light debris. The main issue that we came to solve was that the oven vent is improperly installed. They are not using an insulated double walled duct that goes straight up. They’re using a bath vent that goes to a dormer vent. When they run their whole house fan, it causes the air to flow back into the kitchen. We will be removing the bathroom duct and installing another roof vent straight up. The existing roof vent should be closed off inside the attic. This will also free up the dormer vent to allow for more air to flow outside of the attic when the whole house pan is running. Will also air seal and reinstall R 38.\n\nCustomer profile: this is the father of a customer of mine. It is a referral.

He said he wants it so clean and nice that his wife and daughter can go down there and take their shoes off lol.\n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS: no hazards to speak of, but they did just get a tankless hot water installed in the crawlspace and their furnace is down there as well so just be mindful of the mechanical systems down there. They just got the tankless water heater installed last week so let’s take good care of it\n\nOUT OF ORIGINARY / FINAL THOUGHTS: the crawl door is the only thing I foresee giving us any issues.

You'll need to install a gable vent and then install the gable fan.\n\nAlso, to the far right of the attic, there's a vaulted stealing and the existing batting is pushed up against the vent holes and blocking the holes so you need to pull down the batting about 6 to 8 inches which will open up the holes at the top of the vaulted ceiling, which will allow the vents to work\n\nAfter we are all done, we're gonna blow 6 inches of insulation in the whole attic except for the batting\n\nThis way, it'll look really nice for them to sell their house\n\n3.

The larger items can just be moved aside to clean and put back. I noticed droppings around the interior perimeter mostly and in the corners. We will need to pull out all the bins so we can sanitize the racks as well. Everything will go back in once we are done. I suggest bringing some rags to wipe any sanitizer if things get too wet or wiping down the personal items. I would also use the fogger to provide some more coverage without having to soak everything down. \n3. Customer Profile: Robyn is very nice and is looking forward to this. She has company coming in Thursday and wants things clean. \n4. Obstructions and Hazards: There aren’t too many obstacles here accept what I mentioned above. \n5. Specialty Jobs / Final Thoughts: For the most part, this is pretty straightforward with above mentioned. Like I said this isn’t our typical scope so just be careful moving the personal items and clean this one up good.

The attic has trussing but is fairly easy to move around.\n\n\n\nCustomer Profile:\n\nThe customer is an older couple and they seem pretty cool, but the wife is really freaked out about having mice in her kitchen and I could not figure out where they’re coming from. They may have left the door open and a mouse got in.

The crawlspace entrance is on the left side of the house if you are looking at the house from the street. 1 story. \n\nCustomer profile \n-nice very professional couple. Attention to detail. Rodents are the biggest concern. \n\nObstructions \n-there is a whole house fan in the attic the you may need to cut the strap to get by but just do it in a way that you can just staple the strap back up. \n\nSpecial job notes \n-the home owner has stuff holes around the perimeter with rocks. Pay actors attention to the crawlspace vents because there are a lot of possible entry pints at these vents so seal them very well. The main entry point seems to be the water heater that is right next to the crawlspace door. Seal the heater heater room as best as possible. I say as best as possible because obviously the water heater is in the way. Do what is reaching from the inside of the water heater but also seal this water heater from inside of the crawlspace. Put a whole peace of mesh to block it from the bottom. Also seal the pipe in the water heater room that goes up into the attic space. There are a lot of droppings along the edge of the crawlspace closest to the sub floor. Vacuum the edge very good (video photos). \n\nJust to confirm we are not installing insulation in the crawlspace. The only reason I say this is because I provided the customer with 2 quotes and he said that it looks like both were approved but from what I can see only one was approved and that is the one with no insulation in the crawlspace which I confirmed with him. 	13502.19	13502.19	0.00	2025-08-07 10:49:02.709	2025-07-10 17:47:57.727	2025-08-01 13:52:04.438-03	2025-08-18 08:40:24.945-03	\N	\N

I was able to briefly speak with her husband over the phone. The sellers did some mold remediation along with antimicrobial paint, but it doesn’t look like they did a thorough job, they also didn’t remove the insulation or spray near the soffit vents. \n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS:\n\nNo obstructions or hazards l\n\nOUT OF ORIGINARY / FINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nBoth homeowners are new buyers. The previous attic work was a partial fix and didn’t fully address the mold concerns. We’re coming in to improve ventilation, remove contaminated insulation, and perform minor mold remediation around the soffit/intake vents.\n\nIf you speak with the homeowners, please reassure them that these steps will make a significant difference and greatly reduce the risk of mold returning.\n\nWe’ll also be doing minor insulation work in the crawlspace to address the pre-inspection callouts.

There are two attics one located on the top level and one on the main level in the closet. Since this is a true mix out, we will need to create plastic tunnels from the entries to haul out the batting\n\nBUILDING DETAILS: original insulation with batting insulation over the top of it. There are some light debris up in the attic as well. Also, exterior rodent proofing will be needed on this project.\n\nCUSTOMER PROFILE: really sweet couple they’ve been in the house for quite some time now they’re two kids live in the home as well. \n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS: no obstructions, but a part of the scope of work there will need to be an electrical inspection done to ensure that the rodents haven’t chewed on any of the wiring as this problem has been going on for sometime now.\n\nOUT OF ORDINARY/ FINAL THOUGHTS: the install of the new attic hatch should be coordinated before we start the job if possible. The current access on the second level is less than ideal and to be honest will be much more challenging. So if we can schedule Nathan to go out to do that work prior, we will have a much better time with this job.	14397.29	12237.70	0.00	2025-08-06 23:36:20.027	2025-08-06 21:37:50.724	2025-08-07 09:18:08.814-03	2025-08-18 08:40:24.984-03	fishdoc242@gmail.com	425-881-9244

The person that you will be dealing with on the day of the job is the owner/husband. His name is Rich. Rich is very hands-on. He will probably be watching everything you do. Not in a negative way he is just retired and he used to be a handyman so he’s just into the stuff. For the set up we are gonna do nylon runners for about the first 10 to 15 feet in the hallway he does not want plastic wrapped in that portion of the hallway then you’ll make a left-hand turn down the hallway which will also have the nylon runners on the ground. In that portion of the hallway, he does want plastic, but be careful with the tank the tape as he has just repainted the walls. When you go up into the attic, the gable fan will be to your left. I’m sorry the gable vent where you will add. The gable fan will be on your left. And then you’ll go to the complete opposite side of the house inside the attic and there are two areas that are going to have blown in fiberglass on the right hand side, which was edited on my photos. There will be a huge 4 x 50‘ beam. You’re gonna stick the hose on the other side of that beam and fill up the entire cavity until you reach the pony wall which the pony wall has yellow insulation at that pony wall stop. Then on the complete opposite side, you will see another pony wall with white batting insulation in it at the top portion of each bay, which is 16 inches on center. You’re gonna pull the batting insulation out of the top cavity and run the hose all the way down and we’re gonna fill up every single cavity that run 16 inch run center, and then put the white batting back after you are finished.\nAnd again the gable fan will be installed via the pictures. I edited and attached to builder trend where the Gable fan goes. That is it.	3700.00	3330.00	0.00	2025-08-05 18:53:47.507	2025-08-05 17:00:32.347	2025-08-06 11:11:54.933-03	2025-08-18 08:40:25.258-03	surfbear@gmail.com	619-606-3992

I had the opportunity to meet her in person, but her husband was at work at the time. She would like to move forward with the project due to the severity of the rodent infestation and the overall condition of her attic. The main points that resonated with her were air quality concerns, rodent entry points, compromised insulation that is no longer effective for energy efficiency, and the importance of ensuring rats don’t chew through the remaining knob and tube wiring, which could pose a fire risk. Luci is intelligent, friendly, and appreciates clear, honest communication. Be straightforward with her and feel free to keep her updated as the project progresses if she expresses interest.\n\nI did not meet her husband, but according to Luci, he would likely want to tackle most of the project himself, especially the crawlspace portion. It’s recommended to avoid getting into conversations with him about the project scope, as he may focus on finding gaps or flaws in the work to justify the belief that the project isn’t worth the investment. That’s based on what Luci has shared. Beyond that, this is a RP3 job in the attic, the customer has requested that we install batting insulation, but avoid touching the knob and tube wiring throughout the attic. To accomplish this, we will be installing R-11 16 inch batting in between the joists, doing custom cuts to avoid the knob and tube. We will follow up with a R–38 24” batting on top, this batting will also be cut or installed to avoid covering or touching the knob and tube wiring. The customer is aware that this will leave open canals, where there’s no insulation, greatly reducing the energy efficiency of their attic space. The customer also acknowledges that based on the batting material, we will do our best to make it look clean, but clean cuts will not be possible. We will also be tackling a smaller RP3 job in the crawlspace, which is open to a finished basement (custom crawl hatch on hinges necessary for rodent warranty, given accessibility to crawlspace through window, windows or side door in basement. Please check in with PM Nathan Woods with any questions regarding this project—I’m happy to help.	12750.28	10200.22	0.00	2025-08-04 21:36:59.716	2025-07-16 19:16:04.026	2025-08-01 13:52:06.361-03	2025-08-18 08:40:25.344-03	\N	\N

The attic access is located upstairs at the end of the hallway. It is a straight shot up the stairs to the left. \n2. Building Details: This is a two story home with no crawl. The attic hatch is a good size. The attic itself isn’t very big and once inside it isn’t bad to move in. Several ducts in the way though. There is a section of vault that is accessible. This will be batted out and the lower section can probably be pulled with a pole. We are removing all insulation. \n3. Customer Profile: David and his wife are very nice. Original owners of the 40 year home. They were initially wanting storage but there attic isn’t set up for this so we went the efficiency route to restore the attic. For the gable fan, I would recommend mounting it on the gable without the wiring coming through which is the one near the vaulted section. This will allow for better heat removal in my option. \n4. Obstructions and Hazards: There aren’t too many obstacles here accept what I mentioned above. \n5. Specialty Jobs / Final Thoughts: For the most part, this is pretty straightforward with above mentioned. Please reach out with any questions. 	8526.73	7674.06	0.00	2025-08-01 15:01:14.654	2025-07-11 16:40:45.968	2025-08-01 21:59:37.109-03	2025-08-18 08:40:25.514-03	\N	\N

The homeowner is Ali. Nice gentleman he is in the rug making business. The biggest concern for this gentleman is getting all the rodents out. The attic has three entrances. There is an entrance in the garage. There’s one entrance when you go in the garage door into the house the first bedroom on the right hand side, which is the son’s bedroom. There is an attic entrance there. And the third attic entrance is located in the master bedroom closet. You’ll need to go in all three entrances in order to remove all of the insulation.

There is no insulation in the garage attic but behind the garage where it starts to go into the house there’s about maybe 30 to 40 ft.² of insulation that needs to be removed and then just vacuum that area but the garage jack you can just use a leaf blower to blow out. There are five air ducts throughout the attic. I believe the second attic entrance has about two or three air ducts that we are going to repair put some insulation around the exposed coil and then use heat tempered flex tape to seal it and then the other two air ducts are in the attic where the master bedroom closet is located.

There are two attic entrances one of them is located in the master bedroom that is the small smaller attic. The main attic is located in the bedroom closet. Best point of entry will more than likely be the front door for both spaces.\n\nBUILDING DETAILS: custom home so the attic that is located in the master bedroom is very tight with a lot of framing. The main attic is pretty straightforward and open. We may want to bring a Skil saw to widen some of the access to the smaller attic from the main. I have a video showing in more detail.\n\nCUSTOMER PROFILE: Helen, who is the homeowner that I met is an older Russian lady. She’s very kind, but not overly talkative. I haven’t met the husband yet, but just exercise, professionalism, and thoughtfulness as if this were your parents house.\n\nOBSTRUCTIONS & HAZARDS: some of the attic has plywood decking that may inhibit us from being able to work in the bowl spaces, so bring a saw or whatever tools needed to gain access to certain areas.\n\nOUT OF ORDINARY/ FINAL THOUGHTS: at the end of day one please bring traps with bait as we will not be returning back to the house for a couple of weeks. Homeowners are very motivated to get this project started and getting this material removed. We will also need to bring some tall ladders to gain access to the roof for rodent proofing. They are concrete tiles with solid decking underneath, so please tread carefully. Some of the trees that you’ll see in my photos will be getting trimmed and cut back on August 1st so no need to mention this to the homeowner on day one.	20175.88	18965.33	0.00	2025-07-30 21:57:38.946	2025-07-29 18:01:57.892	2025-08-01 13:52:02.853-03	2025-08-18 08:40:25.656-03	lozanhelen7386@gmail.com	425-443-7386

There are two attic access points. Main attic is at the top of the stairs and the small attic is in the back basement stairwell.\nThe small attic access is very dangerous. You need an extension ladder on top of a storage shelf that spans over the stairwell. It's pretty sturdy but please be careful. Rodent proofing that section will be difficult but I'm thinking we should mesh off that whole loft area because we won't be able to keep rodents out of the stairwell. This will be a difficult task and that's why I chose cellulose and no warranty. If we seal off the loft I think we can keep the rodents out.\nYou will need an extension ladder for the soffit vents. It's a hipped roof so ideally we want 2 soffits on each side of the roof. Try to get creative but don't put yourself in harm's way. If you have to out 4 on the front and back of the house in the upper attic and 2 down below in the lower attic. These are small spaces so it shouldn't be too labor intensive but the layout of the house makes for a challenging job. \nPlease install the attic fan on the north side of the roof and let me know if you have any questions.	7573.30	7118.91	0.00	2025-07-30 19:49:16.195	2025-07-10 18:36:55.888	2025-08-01 13:52:02.949-03	2025-08-18 08:40:25.678-03	\N	\N

Attic access is in the upstairs closet in the office.\n\nParking in access: parking is in the driveway. Attic access is in the closet in the upstairs office.\n\nBuilding details: late 1980s two-story home in Carlsbad. Most of the attic is vaulted however it is a scissor truss, so you can access that area. Total attic space is a little less than 700 ft.². Will be dealing with about 311 ft.² in the front. It is a small tight attic however I do believe we will be able to get a whole house van in there using an angled grate. The attic area will be dealing with is not tall. You can stand in one skinny little section and then the rest of it is a belly crawl. R 13 insulation in the main area needs to be replaced with something more up-to-date.\n\nCustomer profile: young couple with a young child eight years old. Complaining that the upstairs gets too hot. Does not want to invest in a AC unit just yet.\n\nObstacle/hazards: there is piping in the little attic area and wires. There’s also a lot of thrown around insulation that will be removing just in the 311 ft.² in the front. We will not be dealing with the area above the vaults.\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: this is a unique installation. The angled rate has to go on a wall that is vertical not horizontal and there needs to be three zoned air pathways for the rooms. There does seem to be enough venting for the whole house fan. There’s two Ohagan’s a gable vent and soffit vents. Right now the soffits are blocked by theway the insulation has been thrown around. 	6705.22	6034.70	0.00	2025-07-26 02:10:26.877	2025-07-24 18:44:57.349	2025-08-01 13:52:06.067-03	2025-08-18 08:40:27.323-03	\N	\N

Please expedite finished photos to summer, her email address is on file. She also will be paying the balance after the job is complete.Their main goal is to address any callouts from the pre-inspection, in this case it was that rodent activity was found in the crawlspace, and that they needed someone to clean it up and rodent proof. Most likely no one will be at the home when you arrive. The lockbox code is 4636.There’s a driveway that the van can pull up in, about 15 feet to the front door, then another 20 feet to the crawlspace hatch. The hatches on hinges and there is a metal wire on the shelving unit next to it that you can use to tie around the handle and prop the door open Straightforward RP2 no warranty., vapor barrier replacement, vacuuming around the perimeter of the foundation to make sure no visible Droppings are left on the ledge. Please do your best to make sure the home stays clean and that the crawlspace looks presentable, the home is going on market and will have tours starting Wednesday the 2nd.

It does start off open, then goes tight towards one end.\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: customer was interested in excavating. It is not a possibility, the soil is already below the footings in certain areas and there’s evidence of water intrusion. Further excavation could cause foundation issues.

He originally reached out to us due to a smell in the basement, but after discovering an advanced rodent infestation and mold in the attic, we moved forward with full-scope remediation in both areas. They have two dogs and a one-year-old daughter, so please be sure to keep all doors and the gate to the yard securely closed behind you. When I arrived, the dogs weren’t loose inside, but they may be out during the project. The family is highly focused on maintaining a safe and healthy home environment — the presence of rodents beneath their home and mold in the attic was deeply concerning to them, and the fact that we’re resolving both issues with a 10-year rodent-proofing warranty holds a lot of value. We’ll be performing RP3 in the crawlspace and RP1 in the attic, but the rodent warranty applies to both areas. There were no signs of rodents in the attic — only mold. A few specific items to note: there’s a wired conduit running from the ground to the attic on the east side of the house. It’s been filled with spray foam, but the rodent proofing there could be improved, so please make sure it’s sealed cleanly and visibly. An electrician will be needed to install an outlet for the smart attic fan. Although the attic had proper ventilation and intact baffles, there was still significant mold growth on the north side of the roof decking. The homeowner shared that a dryer vent had detached and had been exhausting directly into the attic for an unknown amount of time, which likely explains the accelerated mold growth despite adequate ventilation. Again, the family is wonderful — please treat them with respect and communicate clearly if they ask about the steps of the rodent or mold remediation. They are very attentive, and with a toddler crawling around, cleanliness is critical. Be mindful not to track in any rodent debris or contaminants — use fresh shoe booties, lay down plastic as needed, and change booties regularly. Thank you, and don’t hesitate to reach out to PM Nathan Woods with any questions — I’m happy to help. NOTE:  Reviewed photos from project and realize afterwards that there was some water pipes that needed insulation, included additional feet on Atech to cover hours needed, please take measurements on site during phase one, to confirm necessary materials. 	27367.16	21893.73	0.00	2025-07-18 15:12:11.444	2025-07-02 23:19:39.975	2025-08-01 13:52:06.776-03	2025-08-18 08:40:27.549-03	\N	\N

There is a small driveway, but I don’t think the truck could fit. There are two attic entrances, one in front of the master bedroom in the addition and the other in the hallway in the main home.\n\nBuilding details: large ranch home in San Diego. Both attic spaces are under 4 feet but not terribly too tight. Not connected. No road activity. The attic above the master bedroom in the addition is fiberglass. The main attic is mainly blown in with one section of fiberglass that was smashed over a bathroom vent. We will need to check the bathroom vent.. There is a mold issue in the home due to a previous leak. The renter is very concerned and has been sick. Was going to sanitize, but now was going to do a full mold remediation. There is a rigid duct in the main attic that has been smashed and will need to be replaced. Looks to be a 6 inch flex, rigid duct. There is a duct in the smaller attic that needs to be re-wrapped because it is open. Homeowner wants to install a 12“ x 12“ gable vent in the front of the home. This will allow cross ventilation from the back. There is also a 200 square-foot section of wall on the outside that we will be spraying the RMR 86 on it and giving it a quick scrub. Attic access to the small attic needs a new attic door. Just drywall I believe it was 18” x 30” in size remeasure just to make sure. \n\nObstacles/hazards: not the biggest addict to deal with. But most of it is easily accessible.\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: there’s a weird dynamic here going between the homeowner and the renter.

You can park in front of the garage if you can parallel park the big truck so that doesn’t stick out on the street. Otherwise it’s street parking and it is limited. Access to the crawlspace is from the side of the home. There’s a door that enters into the utility room off the kitchen and then you go into the basement.\n\nBuilding details: oceanfront two-story home built in the 1930s. Crawlspace about 1600 ft.². Most of it is above 3 feet in height, but there is a portion of it where it’s difficult. Asbestos ducting. Customer says they’ve done a test that said that procedure five was not necessary. I am not convinced. The access to the crawlspace is through a basement. The basement is probably about 150 ft.². You have to climb up on top of this safe like structure to get into the crawlspace. Crawlspace is dry. There’s a fair amount of debris. It’s a mix between the asbestos stuff dick and some old plumbing. Mild mold throughout. Wood readings were low. \n\nCustomer profile Claudia and Cameron have been living here for a while. Cameron suffers from mold in his system. Believes it’s from the crawlspace. Mold test they had done showed elevated counts of mold in the crawl, but not in the home. Very concerned about mold and asbestos.\n\nObstacles and hazards: getting into the crawlspace is going to be difficult in getting the trash out of the crawlspace is gonna be difficult because you have to go in through this little basement.\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: a couple fans could be a big help as well as a full vapor barrier.

He and his wife were both polite during my inspection. If you’re going to interact with either of them, please be ready and prepared to answer any questions effectively back by facts and reason. The main reason why we are called out was for mice getting into their kitchen so part of this project is for air ceiling and rodent proofing in their kitchen behind drawers. At least one junction box is behind a pull out drawer that needs to be wrote proof and sealed, along with other electrical or plumbing. There are two crawlspace one has a lot of debris, and will need additional rodent proofing towards the back, hours have been allotted for it.

We may need to bring some cones because we may be sticking out into the road slightly.\n\nBuilding details\n-technically it is a one story house, but the whole house is above the crawlspace and to get to the front door you do need to go up a set of stairs. For this reason, we may want to bring some extra hoses for the vacuum.\n\nCustomer profile \n-Nice gentlemen.

Attic access is in the hallway, pretty straightforward job. The customer called us out because they were hearing noises in the attic space but there was no trails of rodents, but I did notice that the gable vent was open as if a bird or maybe a bat was getting in there but there’s no signs of rodent activity so I believe that’s the only place we really need to rodent proof Aside from reinforcing some of the Bird blocks. They have three kids if they’re around when we’re spraying mold let them know in case they want to take the kids out of the house other than that there’s no hazards to speak of..	8646.02	8213.71	0.00	2025-07-12 00:05:12.392	2025-07-11 20:10:20.378	2025-08-01 13:52:07.326-03	2025-08-18 08:40:27.773-03	\N	\N

She’s had some negative experiences with contractors in the past, but remains upbeat and open, as long as things are explained clearly and logically. Parking should be straightforward—there’s about a 30-foot walk from the nearest spot to the front door, and another 40 feet to the attic, so be sure to bring extra vacuum hose. The attic has very low clearance, so bring a small crew and plywood boards to lay across joists for safe access.\n\nShe has one older, friendly dog who likely won’t try to escape, but please be mindful when opening doors and side gates. Because of her membrane roof, we’re avoiding rooftop penetrations and installing six soffit vents instead. We’re placing two on the east side and four on the west; the overhang blocks access to more. If the crew finds space under the overhang for additional vents, contact PM Nathan Woods before proceeding.\n\nIf the customer asks about PSC rebates, let her know she may only qualify for the base level due to existing insulation, or defer to the inspector’s assessment. Overall, this is a straightforward job: remove insulation, perform mold remediation, air seal, re-insulate, and adjust ventilation. For any questions, reach out to PM Nathan Woods.

Arnie is a veteran and he used to work at Boeing so is a good combination of analytical but also friendly. This project involves full removal sanitation RP 3 with the addition of adding new ventilation for a bathroom fan and a hood fan. They have at least five holes along in the siding of there home that we have agreed to inspect. As long as there are no birds, chicks or eggs Inside these holes, we will remove accessible debris, sanitize and patch with galvanized steel. Everybody is completely aware that these patch jobs will not be pretty and our temporary fix until they can hire siding company to replace the siding. If there are any birds, chicks, eggs, inside the holes in the siding of the home, they are aware that we will not remove or harm the animals or seal them in. They have a driveway and street parking seemed relatively easy when I went there, I would check with the homeowner to see if we can put the back out tube through the front window. If not bring extra tube just in case as it is someone long run from the driveway in their house and around to the attic entrance. We’ve agreed to relocate some personal belongings from the attic into the hallway below. This is very minimal, a couple typewriters, three or four boxes of bassinet and a large calculator.

Please schedule the 2nd day as TBD for now and Blaine will keep in touch and update asap.  Space is 750 sf with a raised platform central air system. The attic is HOT. The rafters are hot to the touch not just warm. Getting in there early and getting the air moving will be a big priority for the team, I imagine.  Entrance is in the garage no set up needed. Customer is sensitive to mold and we have assured her she is getting a heavy remediation with scrubbing and the full suite of treatment.

There are two attic entrances. There’s one in a loft that is a barn style access in his son‘s room. The other access is the typical master bedroom closet. For this one let’s use the master bedroom closet. Climbing up and down the little ladder that takes you to the loft is going to be difficult\n\nBuilding details: partial two-story home in Huntington Beach. The access is really the only unique thing. Small attic 600 ft.². About 200 ft.² of vertical walls. Moderate rodent activity. Homeowner had another company come in and do the RP. However, there is a dead carcass, which makes me wonder if it was successful.\n\nCustomer profile: the husband is more nonchalant regarding the project. The wife is the main instigator. Three kids in the house. The ducting has been chewed into and they’re very concerned about the quality of air inside their home.\n\nObstructions and hazards: the attic is small and the ducting is difficult to get around in. There also is some electrical damage due to chewing, but the homeowner has a friend who is an electrician and will come and check the job in between the first and the second day.\n\nSpecialty/final thoughts: due to the customers concern regarding the ducting we may have to return and do a duct cleaning job on the first floor.	9393.58	8923.90	0.00	2025-07-08 11:09:04.907	2025-06-16 15:43:10.347	2025-08-01 13:52:08.319-03	2025-08-18 08:40:28.193-03	\N	\N

Access to the crawlspace is at the rear of the home. \n2. Building Details: This is a manufactured home and most of the work will be in the crawlspace. The crawl is fairly easy to move around in once you navigate through the ductwork. A company has tried to seal things up over the years but there are severely for rodents to get in. RP will be tedious so take your time. \n3. Customer Profile: Nancy And Rich are really nice. The rodent issue scares her and they want this finally resolved for good. The rodents have tried to get into the kitchen via the pipes so take a good look at all the piping underneath once all the insulation is pulled. \n4. Obstructions and Hazards: There aren’t too many obstacles here accept what I mentioned above. \n5. Specialty Jobs / Final Thoughts: For the most part, this is pretty straightforward. The duct we are replacing is connected to a T/Y. The current duct is kinda stripped so look for that. Be sure to check all the skirting of the home really well. \n	7819.77	7194.19	0.00	2025-07-07 19:20:12.896	2025-06-30 17:20:55.262	2025-08-01 13:52:08.619-03	2025-08-18 08:40:28.316-03	\N	\N
